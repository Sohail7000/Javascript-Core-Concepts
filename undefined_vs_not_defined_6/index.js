//js is loosely and weakly typed language i.e a varibale could be a number a string a boolean etc

//Summary
// 1. Undefined is like a placeholder till a variable is not assigned a value.
// 2. undefined !== not defined
// 3. JS- weakly typed language since it doesn't depend on data type declarations.
